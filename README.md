A collection of example files for learning various tools such as LaTeX

The latex_example zip file should be downloaded and unzipped to a folder to be kept together. Files are dependent upon each other. The .tex file is the one to be executed.

For MacOS TeXShop is a good software package for using LaTeX and comes with a bibliography manager too, BibDesk: https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/.

Windows and MacOS users may find TeXStudio similarly useful: https://www.texstudio.org.

Linux users may find TeX Live the most useful: https://www.tug.org/texlive/ (also available for MacOS and Windows).
